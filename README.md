understand annotation like navigator wants to point out something in 3d plane to show in user's camera
now i want to implement 3d annotations to send from navigator to user using AR kit or any other you know but easy so implement that in this code  i shared navigator and user page with socket services so give me code without an error of implementing 3d annotations (like navigator is pointing out something but in 3D) by the navigator to sent to user.  and when user moves the camera the annotation shold be there on the object that navigator wants to point out  and dont give me too much long code i want a simple code just 3d annotations sending from navigator to user only vwery simple implementation just give me very simple code not too much complex. give me short code.
