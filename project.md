# Project
I want to make a flutter app in my macOS so it contains following functionalities..
want to run ipad as a user and my mac's chrome as a aid. so give me code accordingly.
So in ui part I want to make only 2 buttons 1. User and 2. Aid 
1. When user will be clicked:
- It opens a camera and makes it live camera view to the person who was clicked Aid. So there constraint is Aid should be there if there is no one clicked on Aid button then just popup that there is no Aid available please wait a while.

2 When Aid clicked: 
- So it can see the live camera which user have recording to it is live sharing from user to Aid screen 
- After that Aid has ability to draw in 3D something in the screen and arrow option is also there so point out the thing.
- Now the 3D drawing from the Aid is shown to user that Aid is something drawn here.
- And the drawing is should be in 3d, so when user move the camera the point which is done by Aid is should be there on the object where he was pointing out.

put all files in lib/ no need to seperate folders it is not that much big project no need of comments and extra spaces

so the main problem is how aid will know the distance from user's camera to perticular object because aid can see live stream only in screen so he can not estimate the distance. so for that use hit testing and pose matrix for that and so something so that wherever aid wants to point out and want to tell to user that by pressing this button your problem can be solve this is example. also another use case is that older person wants to login in netflix in his TV so he don't know how to do that. so he use this app can stream his camera feed to aid and aid will help by point out and telling that next step is this after that do this

now i want is that by seeing the camera of user aid can able to make drawing by using brush in the screen and that will appear to user in 3D manner so this is the basic idea if user stuck in problem he need help from aid so how aid will know by only from his screen that the distance from user to the object for he need help is that much far away?? so use logic and give me code which the capable that aid can draw in 3d and it is sharing to user via socket in 3d and user also can see that iin 3d world so give me that kind of code without any error and make sure data is transfering properly and user also see it in his camera properly

give me code without an error and give packages version which compatible with both ipad and mac's chrome. also file name should be in one word and small. give full code without an error and comments and extra spaces and the code will run as per i mentioned that aid in chrome and user will as ipad




Give me very simple and basic code designing is not needed so just simple code which run all the functionality and also simple drawing like just one marker is needed so make it simpler and give me simple code so if I want to update then I will tell you.


## After 
And save the solved problem by Aid so if user stuck again in the same problem so he can refer from there.

You are an expert Flutter developer. I want you to write a Flutter app (all code in lib/, no folders, no comments, no extra spaces) that runs on iPad (as "User") and Mac's Chrome browser (as "Aid") with these features:

- The main UI has only 2 buttons: "User" and "Aid".
- When "User" is clicked:
    - Open the device camera and stream live video to the "Aid" device.
    - If no Aid is connected, show a popup: "No Aid available, please wait a while."
- When "Aid" is clicked:
    - Show the live camera stream from the User.
    - Allow Aid to draw in 3D (brush and arrow) on the video stream, using the mouse or touch.
    - The 3D drawing is anchored to real-world objects in the User's camera view using hit-testing and pose matrix logic, so the annotation stays in place as the User moves the camera.
    - The 3D drawing is sent in real time to the User, who sees it overlaid in their camera feed in correct 3D space.
- All data transfer (video and 3D drawing) must use sockets/WebRTC or a compatible real-time solution for iPad and Chrome.
- The code must include all necessary logic for 3D annotation, pose estimation, hit-testing, and real-time sync.
- All code must be in a single lib/ folder, file names should be in one word and lowercase.
- Do not include any comments or extra spaces.
- Use only packages that are compatible with both iPad (iOS) and Chrome (web).
- Give me the exact package versions used.
- The code must be error-free and fully runnable as described.
- If any requirement is unclear, ask clarifying questions before coding.

This app is for remote assistance: for example, an older person can stream their TV screen to a helper, who can point out which button to press by drawing an arrow in 3D space, and the annotation remains anchored as the camera moves.

Wait for my confirmation of your plan before writing any code.

# Flutter AR Remote Assistance App – Prompt for Claude Opus-4

You are a professional Flutter and WebRTC + AR/3D developer. I want you to give me a full working Flutter codebase (compatible with macOS and iPadOS) in **one single file (inside `lib/`)** without using extra folders or comments. My goal is to create a remote assistance app with two modes: **User (runs on iPad)** and **Aid (runs on Mac's Chrome browser via Flutter Web)**.

## App UI:
The main screen has two buttons: `User` and `Aid`.

## When "User" is clicked (iPad):
- It opens the **live camera feed using ARKit or a compatible AR library**.
- Streams this live feed via **WebRTC or socket** to the Aid running on Chrome.
- If no Aid is available, show a popup: "No Aid available. Please wait."

## When "Aid" is clicked (Chrome):
- It receives the user's live camera stream.
- On the stream, the Aid can draw **in 3D** using a brush or arrow tool.
- The drawing coordinates must sync using WebSocket or WebRTC.
- The drawing appears **anchored to the 3D world from User’s camera view** — not just an overlay.

## Main Technical Goals:
- Ensure **WebRTC or WebSocket** communication between User and Aid is stable and synced in real-time.
- Use **AR hit testing or pose matrix** logic on the User side to map the Aid's drawing coordinates to 3D space.
- The User should see drawings fixed in space on the object (e.g. buttons on a remote, a TV screen), even if the camera moves.
- Example use case: An older adult wants to log in to Netflix on their TV; Aid guides them by pointing/drawing live on the video feed.

## Packages to Use (Latest Compatible Versions):
- `camera`
- `ar_flutter_plugin` or `arkit_plugin`
- `flutter_webrtc`
- `web_socket_channel`
- `vector_math`

## Requirements Recap:
- Single file in `lib/`, name it `main.dart`.
- No comments, no extra spacing, no unused imports.
- Fully working and error-free.
- Make sure it works on iPad as the "User" and Chrome (macOS) as the "Aid".
- Data must sync properly and drawings must appear as 3D anchored objects in User’s AR camera.

Now write the complete Flutter code accordingly.
